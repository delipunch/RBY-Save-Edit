Untitled RBY/GSC on-cartridge save editor

Right now it incorrectly displays Trainer ID, and correctly count party size (from my limited testing, it correctly counted the size with 1, 2, and 3 'mons) for Gen I only.

Compiled with GBDK 2020
Runs on real hardware with an EMS USB 64Mb Smart Card (Note 1).

Note 1: For the foreseeable future, a cartridge with multiple ROM banks sharing the same SRAM banks will be required.
